  8. PCB board, available in the PCB folder. You can order a custom PCB board from (for example) https://jlcpcb.com/ by uploading the .zip file on their website

#2. Assembling

For assembling you only need a soldiering iron, the assembly is pretty straightforward and you should be able to do it yourself by simply putting the pieces "in the right place" as indicated on the PCB itself.

#3. Software

Once you have done with assembling upload the software in the SRC folder on your arduino via USB. The software is strongly based on the lightmeter from https://github.com/vpominchuk/lightmeter. 

#4. Case

Coming soon

#5. Have fun with your lightmeter


DISCLAIMER:
The present lightmeter is, at this time, still untested. I am working on this version and trying to test it as soon as possible, but due to Corona, I have seen my orders being delayed more and more. I tested a previous version and, apart from some battery issues (that I should have solved in this version 1.1) it seemed to be working just fine. 

Just remember that the input power should not exceed 5v, or you will risk making your arduino useless.

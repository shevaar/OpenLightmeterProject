8. PCB board, available in the PCB folder. You can order a custom PCB board from (for example) https://jlcpcb.com/ by uploading the .zip file on their website

2. Assembling

For assembling you only need a soldiering iron, the assembly is pretty straightforward and you should be able to do it yourself by simply putting the pieces "in the right place" as indicated on the PCB itself.

3. Software

Once you have done with assembling upload the software in the SRC folder on your arduino via USB. The software is strongly based on the lightmeter from https://github.com/vpominchuk/lightmeter. 

4. Case
